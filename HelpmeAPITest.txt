1) Regarding API Booking Test project -

##Created Maven project and added all dependencies in pom.xml required to run the project. Below Added new libraries with detailed description
##To run test-cases -> Run testNG.xml file
	*Added 7 test cases for 3 APIs including Positive and some Negative cases mentioned in requirement
    *Test Data read from DataProviderFile
    *Adding Assertions for test cases verification

# Created testNG Project -

    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    	<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    	<version>6.9.10</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

**Advantages - 
	* Provides DataProvider so that run test cases with different inputs. Reading test data from separate file.
	* Provides Reporting so that we can sent to stakeholders

# Create TestConstants file - Storing URL and constants file. All constant data can be configured here.
# Create TestHelper file - Where test data setup and reusable functions added.
# Adding Javadocs to know what test case does
 
# Rest Assured library

<dependency>
         <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
         <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
         <version>3.0.0</version>
         <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

**Advantages - 
	* Library to hit APIs using Behaviour Driven Framework
	

# Lombok library

<dependency>
         <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
         <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
         <version>1.18.4</version>
</dependency>

**To generate getter/setters and to strig method for classes

# To run from Jenkins, ned these plugins
